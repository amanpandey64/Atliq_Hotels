# Atliq_Hotels
Today I made one more interesting project which is about AtliQ Hospitality Revenue Dashboard with codebasics.

I have prior knowledge of hospitality sector as I did my graduation in the same field and I also understand key metrics and measures which are crucial for measuring performance and making informed decisions.

ðŸ’¼ Why Power BI in Hospitality? 
The hospitality industry thrives on data-driven decision-making. Whether it's optimizing revenue management, enhancing guest experiences, or improving operational efficiency, the ability to derive data effectively is very crucial. Power BI is a comprehensive tools that enable us to visualize, analyse, and gain actionable insights from our data.

Tools Used :-
#PowerQuery : for data cleaning and profiling
#DAX : for implementing various hospitality metrics
#PowerBI : for visualisation and building relationship among various data sets ( #starschema ) 

Highlights of the Project :
KPIâ€™s : Various Key Performing Indicators such as Revenue, REVpar (Revenue per available room), DSRN (Daily Sellable Room Nights), Realisation %age, Occupancy %age (how many rooms are occupied from the available rooms) and ADR (Average Daily Rate) are shown on the top for better insights.
RevPAR is Revenue generated per available room ( Sold and unsold)
Occupancy is how many rooms are occupied from the available rooms.
ADR (Average Daily Rate) is average price for rooms sold in a given time period.
DSRN (Daily Sellable Room Nights) tells about how many rooms are ready to sell in a day.
Realization is how many rooms were actually utilized among booked rooms.
This dashboard analyses 3 months of booking data to provide insights.
Weekdays for hotel industry starts from Sunday to Thursday and Weekends are Friday and Saturday. 

Key Learnings :-  
Revenue from Luxury as a category is more (61.62%) than Business (38.38%).
On weekends, Atliq Hotel chains has higher Occupancy (63%), REVpar (7972) and Realisation rate (71%) than on weekdays.
ADR plays a crucial role in determining the pricing of a hotel room, and by analysing the same one can get insights about Hotel's pricing strategy, whether they are selling rooms on flat pricing, weekday/weekend pricing or dynamic pricing.
Hotelâ€™s rating and occupancy percentage has correlation with the performance of the hotel.
Users are generally tend to book rooms based on ratings and reviews. So Good Service leads to Good rating which leads to Good Occupancy and ultimately Good Revenue and Profits for the hotel.
Focus should be made on underperforming cities and properties.
The Pareto Principle, also known as the 80/20 rule or the law states that, in many situations, approximately 80% of the effects come from 20% of the causes. Pareto Principle serves as a valuable tool for identifying the most significant areas of focus, optimizing resources, and improving decision-making by recognizing the unequal distribution of results or effects.
